Check out my first console app [Assignments/Calculator_app.cs]


**-  Brief description:**
> This a console based calculator, based on an assignment given to me through my course. I have however, continued development,
 with the aim of experimenting and practicing the skills I have learned.

 
> Although this is basic and to the initiated, humbly shallow in features, I was very proud of my tinkering with this one.
I put into practice what I had self taught through online classes and material. As an IT technician who works in a school,
I was fortunate enough to be exposed to lots of great reading material.


**- What I learned..**
1. Exercised my knowledge of conditionals, methods and functions.
2. Learned about parsing variable types and string interpolation.
3. Practiced using multiple debugging techniques such as incorporating breakpoints, throwing null reference errors etc
4. updating my personal documentation for C# ( aka my wiki)
   

**- What I would like to do next**
* [x] A handle for exceptions 
* [ ] switch statements ( to replace “if” statement blocks) 
* [ ] Add more depth to it's function with the obvious division and modulus operators.
* [ ] Ui, with a clean and simple interface , practice and experiment with these elements
* [x] Committing this to git and becoming familiar with this process
* [ ] Possibly playing with audio elements and researching this.
